Tiling-based Multislice algorithm for conventional TEM image simulations

This Python software integrates a tiling method into the multislice algorithm for CTEM images and diffraction patterns
The aim is to generate large of view TEM simulations previously unseen. 
It can also provide a time reduction for multislice simulations on standard laptops and CPUs.

We are attempting to publish this software currently.
